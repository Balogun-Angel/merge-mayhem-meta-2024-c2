## Variables

In order to save the DOM references to your HTML elements, you must store them in variables.

Let's breakdown the syntax to **declare a variable** in JavaScript.

```javascript
var varName = value;
```

- `var`: This keyword defines a variable. There are three types of variables that were introduced with the [ES6 JavaScript revision](http://es6-features.org/#Constants). To declare a variable, developers may now define a variable as `var`, `const`, and `let`. We will explain in more detail below the difference between these variable types.
- `varName`: Name of your variable.
- `=`: Similar to most programming languages, the `=` symbol is used to define and set a variable name to a specific value.
- `;`: All JavaScript lines of code and statements must end with a semicolon `;`.

To define an empty variable, just define the type of variable and name, and end with a semicolon (e.g `var varName`).
