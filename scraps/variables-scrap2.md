#### `var`, `let`, and `const`

In some programming languages, like Java and C++, when declaring a variable you must specify the data type (integer, String, float, boolean, etc.) In JavaScript, a variable does not need to be specifically defined in its declaration. Instead, the keyword `var`, `const`, and `let` define how a variable can be used and/or changed.
